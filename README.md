Very shortly:

Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations, solved using Runge-Kutta methods (including adaptive ones) - reused from the electrical field lines project with basically no change (there is some change in the adaptive method in order to compile this). This is the four dimensional system, the lowest dimensional one exhibiting chaos. Features a nice strange attractor.

### TOOLS

The project compiles on Windows with Visual Studio 2026 (the code can be compiled with older versions starting with VS 2015, but it's currently maintained with VS 2026 and C++ 17 or higher).

### LIBRARIES

The program requires the typical VC++ runtime libraries.
Additional libraries needed are VTK https://vtk.org/ and wxWidgets https://wxwidgets.org/.
